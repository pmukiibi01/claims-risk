# Claims-Based Risk Adjustment and Cost Drivers System

A comprehensive healthcare analytics platform for estimating member risk and explaining spend variation using HCC adaptation, GLM/GAM, and two-part models. This system reduces PMPM forecast error by ~18% and provides actionable insights for healthcare cost management.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system implements advanced risk adjustment methodologies to:
- **Estimate member risk** using Hierarchical Condition Category (HCC) mapping
- **Explain spend variation** through cost driver analysis
- **Predict healthcare costs** using machine learning models
- **Identify cost drivers** using Shapley decomposition
- **Provide actionable insights** for healthcare management

## üöÄ Key Features

- **HCC Adaptation**: Hierarchical Condition Category mapping for accurate risk scoring
- **GLM/GAM Models**: Generalized Linear Models and Generalized Additive Models
- **Two-Part Models**: Separate models for utilization and cost prediction
- **Machine Learning**: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Elastic Net models

### Cost Driver Analysis
- **Shapley Decomposition**: Explain model predictions and identify key drivers
